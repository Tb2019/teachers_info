This paper proves that a DNN is more likely to encode both too simple interactions and too complex interactions, but is less likely to learn interactions of intermediate complexity.\nThis paper (Neurips 2021) provides a unified view to explain different adversarial attacks and defense methods, i.e., the view of multi-order interactions between input variables of DNNs. Based on the multi-order interaction, we discover that adversarial attacks mainly affect high-order interactions to fool the DNN. Furthermore, we find that the robustness of adversarially trained DNNs comes from category-specific low-order interactions. Our findings provide a potential method to unify adversarial perturbations and robustness, which can explain the existing defense methods in a principle way.\nInterpretable Convolutional Neural Networks. We add additional losses to force each convolutional filter in our interpretable CNN to represent a specific object part. In comparisons, a filter in ordinary CNNs usually represents a mixture of parts and textures. We learn the interpretable CNN without any part annotations for supervision. Clear semantic meanings of middle-layer filters are of significant values in real applications.\nExplanatory Graphs for CNNs. We transform traditional CNN representations to interpretable graph representations, i.e., explanatory graphs, in an unsupervised manner. Given a pre-trained CNN, we disentangle feature representations of each convolutional filter into a number of object parts. We use graph nodes to represent the disentangled part components and use graph edges to encode the spatial relationship and co-activation relationship between nodes of different conv-layers. In this way, the explanatory graph encodes the potential knowledge hierarchy hidden inside middle layers of the CNN.\nThis paper (Neurips 2021) proposes a method to visualize the discrimination power of intermediate-layer visual patterns encoded by a DNN. Specifically, we visualize (1) how the DNN gradually learns regional visual patterns in each intermediate layer during the training process, and (2) the effects of the DNN using non-discriminative patterns in low layers to construct disciminative patterns in middle/high layers through the forward propagation. Based on our visualization method, we can quantify knowledge points (i.e., the number of discriminative visual patterns) learned by the DNN to evaluate the representation capacity of the DNN.", "social_job": null, "picture": "http://qszhang.com/files/photo.png", "education": null, "qualification": null, "job_information": 1, "responsibilities": "Associate Professor", "office_address": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "origin": "http://qszhang.com/"}, {"name": "Shiyu Liang", "school_id": 104, "college_id": 167, "phone": "021-54740299,18602808513", "email": "jhc@sjtu.edu.cn", "job_title": "Assistant Professor", "abstracts": "Assistant Professor (tenure-track)\nJohn Hopcroft Center for Computer Science\nShanghai Jiao Tong University", "directions": "Machine Learning: Deep Neural Nets; Reinforcement Learning; Robust Training\nOptimization: Non-convex and Non-Differentiable Optimization\nApplied Probability: Statistical Learning Theory; Random Graph Dynamics", "talent_title": null, "administrative_title": null, "education_experience": null, "work_experience": null, "patent": null, "project": null, "award": null, "paper": null, "social_job": null, "picture": "https://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/uploadfile/2023/1226/20231226120537939.jpg", "education": null, "qualification": null, "job_information": 1, "responsibilities": "Assistant Professor", "office_address": null, "origin": "https://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/people/members/faculty/shiyu-liang.html"}, {"name": "Shizhen Zhao", "school_id": 104, "college_id": 167, "phone": null, "email": null, "job_title": "Tenure-track associate professor", "abstracts": "I am currently a tenure-track associate professor in Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
